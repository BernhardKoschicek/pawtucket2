			<p>The ceramics collection of the Everson is widely recognized for its magnitude and magnificence. The ceramics collection of the Everson is widely recognized for its magnitude and magnificence. Today, the collection of ceramics numbers over 5,000 pieces that range in date from 1000 CE to the present, including works by ancient Americans of the Southwest to the most cutting-edge examples by contemporary artists.</p>
			<p>Currently one of the largest holdings of American ceramics in the nation, the Everson's collection can be attributed to the decisions made by Carter in the early 20th century. After the initial purchase of Adelaide Alsop Robineau porcelains in 1916, the Everson acquired more of her artworks. Then, in 1932, the Ceramic National exhibitions were established by Anna Wetherill Olmstead at the Museum in Robineauâ€™s memory.</p>
			<p>An important series of exhibitions that ultimately changed the public opinion on ceramics (from craft to art form), the Ceramic Nationals enabled the Everson to amass a singular collection of American ceramics produced in the twentieth century.</p>
			<p>The American Art Pottery collection, a diverse grouping of over 2,000 pieces, includes both hand-crafted ceramics and examples of commercial ware. The Everson has exemplary works by most of the major potters, including Robineau, Rookwood, Fulper, Grueby, Tiffany, George Ohr, Newcomb and Marblehead.</p>
			<p>The period spanning the 1930s to 1960s is documented by significant pieces from the major movements of those decades. In the area of figurative sculpture, there are works by Wayland Gregory, Suzy Singer, Vally Wieselthier, Victor Schreckengost and Guy Cowan. Mid-century pots reflective of European and Japanese influences are by such seminal artists as Warren MacKenzie, Gertrude and Otto Natzler, Ken Ferguson and Paul Soldner. The collection also includes important ceramic works by American innovators Peter Voulkos, Rudy Autio, Beatrice Wood, Robert Arneson and Howard Kottler.</p>
			<p>Recent developments in ceramic sculpture are outlined by works by Michael Lucero, James Makins, Viola Frey, Betty Woodman, Adrian Sax and Ralph Baccera. In addition to the American ceramics collection, the Everson houses collections of ceramics from around the world, numbering around 1,500 pieces. These range in date from a Chinese funerary urn from 3000 BCE to contemporary examples of European and Japanese ceramic art.</p>
			<p>We invite you to visit the Syracuse China Center for the Study of American Ceramics of the Everson Museum of Art to learn more about this collection.</p>
