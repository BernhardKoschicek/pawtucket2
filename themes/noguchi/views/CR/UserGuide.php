                                <p>Current artwork numbers are based on the catalogue numbers first assigned to objects in The Sculpture of Isamu Noguchi, 1924–1979: A Catalogue by Nancy Grove and Diane Botnick (Garland, 1980), originally 1–820, ordered chronologically. Artworks created after the publication of the Grove/Botnick catalogue are assigned a number above 820. Sculptures discovered after the publication of Grove/Botnick but dated prior to 1979 are generally incorporated into the chronological order by the assignment of an existing number with the addition of the suffix “.01,” “.02,” “.03,” etc. For example, no. 135 is a 1934 portrait included in Grove/Botnick, while no. 135.01, also a 1934 portrait, was discovered after the catalogue’s publication.</p>

                                <p>Titles are presented as designated by Noguchi in the artist’s records, lifetime publications, and/or exhibition checklists. Multiple titles are given for artworks that were assigned more than one active title. Up to three titles may also be given in circumstances where an artwork’s public title changed over time, with the latest title offered first. In other instances, title variations may instead be indicated in the comments section. Additionally, title errors that have appeared in previous publications, such as misspelled names of portrait sitters, have been corrected rather than maintained.</p>

                                <p>All materials involved in the composition of an artwork are generally listed in descending order from the primary material. Material type is provided to the highest level of determinable specificity. However, in some cases, this is limited by the availability of geological surveys or other laboratory work. Materials in these cases are listed in broader terms.</p>
                                <p>In the case of some marbles, granites, clays, and glazes, the material’s regional source is given to further specify the material type. Often, this is as specified by Noguchi; deference is given to the artist's description of material over formal geological terms, occasionally extending to the inclusion of unconfirmed or unknown regional descriptions or materials.</p>

                                <p>The Isamu Noguchi Catalogue Raisonné aims to provide high-quality photographs of all artworks for reference purposes, including primary and alternative views, historic photographs, and situational photography from studio and exhibition records. Extant photographs of exhibitions are also provided with corresponding exhibition entries.</p>
                                <p>While every effort is made to obtain high-quality photography of each artwork, low-quality photographs may be provided if they are the only available or of special relevance. If no presentable photograph is available for a given artwork, this is indicated by a gray box in place of an image. As new images are obtained they will be added to the site periodically.</p>

                                <p>Dates are given by year or years for each artwork from the point the artwork was begun or presumed to have been begun, and completed or presumed to have been completed. When an artwork was begun and completed within one year, that year is given. When an artwork was begun one year and completed another year, the range of years is given. When an artwork is thought to have been completed within one year, with no definitive evidence, that year is preceded by “circa,” abbreviated as “c.” When an artwork is thought to have been completed in one year or another, with no definitive evidence, a range of years is given preceded by “c.”</p>

	            			<div class="body-text">
                                <p>Dimensions appear in inches, followed by centimeter equivalents in order of height, width, and depth. Measurements are taken in inches, generally to the closest 1/8 of an inch (occasionally to within 1/16 of an inch for very small works, or 1/2 of an inch for very large works). Width is determined by establishing either the front of the sculpture or the widest point; depth is taken at 90 degrees from the established width. Diameters are given in two measurements. For example, a vertical cylinder with a diameter of 8 inches and a height of 3 inches would appear as 3 x 8 x 8 in.</p>
