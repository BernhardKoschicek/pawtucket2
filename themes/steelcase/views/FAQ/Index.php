			<strong>How can I best utilize the art collection website?</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			There are many different search capabilities on here—take advantage of them! You can explore works by color, size, style/movement, artist, subject matter, location and more. Or just put search terms in the upper-right corner box. We’ve also curated featured collections and sets so that visitors can learn about the collection from a thematic standpoint.
		</p>
		<br/>
		<p>
			<strong>Can I save my favorite works so I can easily return to these?</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			You can! It’s easy to create, save and share sets of your favorite works—or ones you plan to request for display use—from the My Sets tab. You can also share sets you’ve created with art@steelcase.com. 
		</p>
		<br/>
		<p>
			<strong>How do I request a work of art for temporary or permanent display use?</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			Contact the art manager using by clicking the envelope in the upper-right corner or send an email directly to art@steelcase.com with the Steelcase-assigned number of each work you’re interested in, along with specifics of the requested use (location, purpose, length of display). 
		</p>
		<p>
			Once we’ve determined whether the requested works are available and suitable for use, we’ll set up a time to show you the works in person. You’ll also be able to view locations for each work, including ones currently out on loan.  
		</p>
		<p>
			You’ll also need to complete an art loan agreement form outlining terms of use, responsibility, and project number to bill for any associated costs (shipping, handling, insurance, framing or restoration charges). 
		</p>
		<br/>
		<p>
			<strong>What if I’m located outside of Grand Rapids?</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			The artwork request process will be the same, except that you won’t be able to view the work(s) in person prior to using them. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Please note that for all requested display use outside of the United States, you will need to complete an international art loan agreement form. Please also take a moment to read about the requirements and associated costs for international art loans. 
		</p>
		<br/>
		<p>
			<strong>Can I request works that are currently on display in corporate office spaces?</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			Possibly—it doesn’t hurt to ask! Some works are not available due to their monetary value, placement and/or significance. Works that are part of a series may also not be available.
		</p>
		<br/>
		<p>
			<strong>Anything else I should know?</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			Photographs can be deceiving. Viewing the work(s) in person, if possible, will give you a better sense of color and scale, and also help in determining whether any restoration or reframing is needed. Sample swatches will also help match colors.
		</p>
