			It was the early 1980s and construction for the Steelcase Global Headquarters in Grand Rapids, Michigan was underway. In tandem with this new development, Robert Pew, then Chairman and CEO, launched an art program to expand the company’s existing collection.
		</p>
		<p>
			With the belief that art made “a positive and lasting contribution to the quality of daily work life”, hundreds of works were purchased for display in the new building, integrating functional architecture and beautiful design with fine and decorative arts from the mid-eighteenth century to the present. Robert Forrest, President of Forrest Designers Ltd and Forrest Fine Arts, and John Lloyd Taylor, Director of The Fine Arts Galleries at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, assisted in the selection and placement of works. 
		</p>

			Over the next two decades, Steelcase continued to grow its collection with art reflecting a variety of styles and movements, cultures and eras, by artists local and international, emerging and established. Corporate offices and showrooms around the globe began to display paintings, sculptures, prints, drawings, and more.

			But by the early 2000s, more than 2,600 of 4,200+ works in the collection were tucked away in storage rooms. And yet employee and customer appreciation for the art was very much alive. 
		</p>
		<p>
			In 2014 a complete inventory of the collection was performed, with data about each work entered into this database for the benefit of Steelcase designers – so that borrowing art would be systematic and seamless.
