				Mentorship among PA professionals helps strengthen the management of protected areas by providing access to experienced conservation professionals.  These mentors work in a voluntary capacity to transfer their knowledge, experience, and proven methodologies to improve the competency of others. Mentorship works together with the Body of Knowledge, Assessment and Certification, and Competence Standards to provide a consistent approach to developing a professional PA workforce.
